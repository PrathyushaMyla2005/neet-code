'''
Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]  # because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9
ðŸ”¹ Approach 1: Brute Force (Nested Loops)
Logic

Try every possible pair (i, j) and check if nums[i] + nums[j] == target.
Complexity

Time: O(nÂ²) (check all pairs)

Space: O(1)

âœ… Works, but very slow for large arrays.

'''
def twoSum(nums, target):
    n = len(nums)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i+1, n):
            if nums[i] + nums[j] == target:
                return [i, j]
'''
ðŸ”¹ Approach 2: Hash Map (Optimal)
Logic

Use a dictionary to store numbers weâ€™ve seen and their indices.

For each number num at index i:

Compute complement = target - num.

If complement already exists in dictionary â†’ we found the answer.

Otherwise, store num with index in dictionary.
Complexity

Time: O(n) (one pass)

Space: O(n) (dictionary storage)

âœ… This is the most efficient solution.
