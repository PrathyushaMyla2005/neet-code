'''ou are given:

A string s (the source).

A string t (the target).

ðŸ‘‰ You need to find the smallest substring of s that contains all characters of t (including duplicates).
If no such substring exists, return an empty string "".

Example 1:Input: s = "ADOBECODEBANC", t = "ABC"
Output: "BANC"
Explanation:

The substring "BANC" is the smallest substring in s which contains A, B, and C.
Time & Space Complexity

Time Complexity = O(nÂ³)

Generating substrings: O(nÂ²)

Checking with Counter (O(n))

â†’ Overall O(nÂ³)

Space Complexity = O(n + m) (hashmaps for substring and target)'''

# Example usage
s = "ADOBECODEBANC"
t = "ABC"
print(minWindow_bruteforce(s, t))  # Output: "BANC"
'''Two Pointers / Sliding Window Approach

Idea:

Use a window [left, right] that slides over s.

Expand right to include characters until all of t is covered.

Then, shrink left as much as possible while still covering t.

Keep track of the minimum length substring.'''
