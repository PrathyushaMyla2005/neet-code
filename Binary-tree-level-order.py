'''üìå Problem: Binary Tree Level Order Traversal

LeetCode #102

You are given the root of a binary tree. You need to return its level order traversal (also known as Breadth-First Search traversal).

üëâ Level Order Traversal means:

Visit all nodes level by level from top to bottom.

At each level, visit nodes from left to right.
        3
       / \
      9   20
         /  \
        15   7

[
  [3],
  [9,20],
  [15,7]
]
Level 0: [3]

Level 1: [9, 20]

Level 2: [15, 7]'''
'''1. Using BFS (Queue) ‚Üí Iterative Approach ‚úÖ (Most common)

Use a queue to traverse the tree level by level.

Start with the root in the queue.

For each level:

Process all nodes in the queue (that belong to this level).

Add their children (left, right) into the queue.

Collect values of this level into a list.

üëâ This is the standard approach.
Time & Space Complexity
‚è± Time Complexity (T.C):

Each node is visited once.

Each node is inserted and removed from queue once.

O(N) where N = number of nodes.

üíæ Space Complexity (S.C):

Queue can hold at most O(N) nodes (in last level of tree).

Result list stores all node values (O(N)).

O(N) overall.'''

    queue = deque([root])       # queue initialized with root

    while queue:                # keep processing until queue empty
        level = []              # store values of this level
        size = len(queue)       # number of nodes at this level

        for _ in range(size):   # process all nodes at this level

                queue.append(node.left)
            if node.right:           # if right child exists
                queue.append(node.right)

        result.append(level)         # add this level to result

    return result

# Example usage
# Build the tree:
#         3
#        / \
#       9   20
#          /  \
#         15   7

root = TreeNode(3)

# Run level order traversal

'''üìå Approach 2: DFS (Depth-First Search) with Recursion
üîé Idea

Normally DFS is used for preorder/inorder/postorder.

But we can also achieve level order by keeping track of the depth (level) of each node.

At each recursive call, we pass the current level.

We store the node‚Äôs value inside result[level].
Time Complexity (T.C)

Every node is visited exactly once ‚Üí O(N).

üìå Space Complexity (S.C)

result stores all nodes ‚Üí O(N).

Recursion call stack can go up to O(H) where H = height of tree.

Worst case (skewed tree): O(N)

Best case (balanced tree): O(log N)

So total = O(N).'''
