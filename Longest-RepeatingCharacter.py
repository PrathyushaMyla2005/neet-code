'''Problem Statement (Simplified)

You are given:

A string s consisting of only uppercase English letters.

An integer k.

ðŸ‘‰ You can replace at most k characters in the string with any other uppercase letter.
Your goal: Find the length of the longest substring that can be obtained where all characters are the same.

ðŸ”¹ Example
Example 1:s = "ABAB", k = 2
We can replace the two 'B's with 'A's â†’ "AAAA", length = 4

ðŸ‘‰ For each pair (i, j) we spend O(n) to construct and analyze substring.
t.c = O(n2)Ã—O(n)=O(n^3)
s.c = o(1)

        for j in range(i, n):              # end index
            hashMap = {}

                    hashMap[word[t]] = 0
                hashMap[word[t]] += 1

            max_freq = max(hashMap.values())

                max_length = max(max_length, j - i + 1)

# Example
word = "AABABBA"
k = 1

'''Sliding Window Approach (Efficient)

Instead of restarting for each substring, we expand and shrink a single window:

Move the right pointer (j) â†’ add character to window.

Keep track of the most frequent char in the window (max_freq).

If the window is invalid (window_length - max_freq > k),
shrink from the left pointer (i).

Otherwise, update max length.
ðŸ‘‰ This way, each character is processed at most twice (once when entering, once when leaving window).

Time Complexity: O(n)

Space Complexity: O(26) (constant for alphabets)

ðŸ‘‰ This way, each character is processed'''
