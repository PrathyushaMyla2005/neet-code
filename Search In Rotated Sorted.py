'''ðŸ”¹ Question: Search in Rotated Sorted Array (LeetCode #33)

You are given:

An array nums that was originally sorted in ascending order.

Then it was rotated at some unknown index (pivot).

Example: [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] rotated at pivot 3 â†’ [4,5,6,7,0,1,2].

A target value that you need to search in the array.

ðŸ‘‰ Task: Return the index of the target if found, otherwise return -1.

ðŸ”¹ Why is this different from normal binary search?

In a normal sorted array, you could just apply binary search directly.
But here, the array is rotated, so it has a "break point".

Example:

Sorted (normal):   [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]  
Rotated:           [4, 5, 6, 0, 1, 2, 3]


See how after 6 it suddenly goes back to 0?
Thatâ€™s the rotation point.

ðŸ”¹ Example 1

Input:

nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 0


The array was [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] originally.

Rotated â†’ [4,5,6,7,0,1,2].

We need to find index of 0.

Answer = 4 (since nums[4] = 0).'''
'''âœ… Approach 1: Brute Force (Linear Search)

ðŸ‘‰ Idea: Just check every element one by one until we find the target.

ðŸ”¸ Algorithm

Loop through the array from index 0 to n-1.

If nums[i] == target, return i.

If not found, return -1.
Time & Space Complexity

T.C. = O(n) â†’ we might scan the whole array.

S.C. = O(1) â†’ no extra space.

ðŸ‘‰ Why not best? Because the question expects us to use binary search (O(log n)) since the array is sorted & rotated.'''
def serch(nums, target):
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        if nums[i] == target:
            return i
    return -1

nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]   # âœ… keep nums as a list
target = 0               # âœ… separate variable
print(serch(nums, target))  # âœ… proper function call
'''
Approach 2: Binary Search with Rotation Check (Optimal)

ðŸ‘‰ Idea:
Even though the array is rotated, one half is always sorted.
We use binary search, but also check which half is sorted to decide where to search next.

ðŸ”¸ Algorithm

Set left = 0, right = n-1.

While left <= right:

Find mid = (left+right)//2.

If nums[mid] == target: return mid.

Check which half is sorted:

If nums[left] <= nums[mid]:
â†’ Left half is sorted.
â†’ If target is in this range â†’ move right = mid-1.
â†’ Else move left = mid+1.

Else:
â†’ Right half is sorted.
â†’ If target is in this range â†’ move left = mid+1.
â†’ Else move right = mid-1.

If not found, return -1.
Time & Space Complexity

T.C. = O(log n) â†’ each step halves the search space.

S.C. = O(1) â†’ only a few variables used.

ðŸ‘‰ This is the best approach because the array is partially sorted â†’ binary search is ideal.
