'''You are given the head of a linked list. Determine whether the linked list contains a cycle.

A cycle means that if we keep following the next pointers, at some point, weâ€™ll revisit a previously visited node â†’ i.e., it loops forever instead of ending with None.

Example 1 (Cycle exists):
1 â†’ 2 â†’ 3 â†’ 4
        â†‘    |
        |____|


Here, node 4 points back to node 2, so it loops forever â†’ Cycle exists âœ…'''

ðŸ”¹ Why use Floydâ€™s Algorithm instead of Hashing?

Hashing uses extra memory â†’ O(n)

Floydâ€™s is memory efficient â†’ O(1)

For interview / placement, Floydâ€™s Cycle Detection is preferred âœ…

ðŸ”¹ Final Summary

Problem: Detect if a linked list has a cycle.

Approaches:

Hashing (O(n) time, O(n) space) â†’ easy

Floydâ€™s Cycle Detection (O(n) time, O(1) space) â†’ optimal

Always mention both approaches in interview â†’ then say Floydâ€™s is optimal.

Do you want me to also show you a step-by-step trace example (like dry run) of Floydâ€™s algorithm with a small list? That will make the "meeting point" idea super clear.'''
